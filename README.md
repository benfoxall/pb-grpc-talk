# An alternative to JSON & REST

We'll explore protobuffers & gRPC as an option for serving content to your front-end code.  We'll dive into some of the technical features and tooling, as well as chatting through higher-level ideas that will help us choose a backend approach to best fit a project.

If I find time to put together some hacks before this talk - then we'll check out those as well!
